abanoub-R - dots

	My personal linux dotfiles repo, contains all
	of my system preferences for every type of
	potential setup I may run.

	These files aim to provide a stable and
	consistent experience across different linux 
	systems.

	[ ======================================== ]
	
	For wayland, you will need the following
	packages:

	wl-clipboard
	grim
	slurp
	gsettings
	wofi

	All wayland configuration can be found in
	main/install.sh, will be ported to all
	configurations soon :)

	[ ======================================== ]

	No additional documentation will be provided 
	as these configurations are not meant to be 
	used by other people, though theres nothing 
	stopping you from using this if you like.

	( This is subject to change in the future. )
