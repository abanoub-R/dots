abanoub-R - dots

	My personal linux dotfiles repo, contains all
	of my system preferences for every type of
	potential setup I may run.

	These files aim to provide a stable and
	consistent experience across different linux 
	systems.

	[ ======================================== ]
	
	For wayland, you will need the following
	packages:

	wl-clipboard
	grim
	slurp
	gsettings
	wofi

	Regarding GSettings, it is used to change
	the system theme. Besides setting it via
	~/.config/gtk-3.0, it is mandatory to set
	it here:

        # Set GTK theme to Adwaita-dark
        $ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Adwaita-dark"

	# Change color scheme to prefer dark mode
	$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'

	[ ======================================== ]

	No additional documentation will be provided 
	as these configurations are not meant to be 
	used by other people, though theres nothing 
	stopping you from using this if you like.

	( This is subject to change in the future. )
